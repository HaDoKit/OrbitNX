/// DEPRECATED / not currently wired up: AppOrchestrator no longer constructs or calls this class -
/// shadPS4 sessions now launch straight into shadPS4's own `--big-picture` mode (see
/// ShadPs4Launcher.LaunchOrFocusAsync) instead of picking a game via the Switch-side library
/// picker screen this class talks to (library.c on the Switch, also deprecated/unwired). Left
/// intact rather than deleted in case that approach is worth reviving - if so, re-add
/// construction + Arm/Disarm/OnSessionStarted/OnSessionStopped wiring in AppOrchestrator.cs (see
/// git history for the exact previous wiring) and pass a real titleId into LaunchOrFocusAsync
/// again.
///
/// Dials the Switch's shadPS4 game-library port and serves one list/selection exchange per
/// connection - modeled directly on Session/SessionController.cs's dial-retry shape, but kept as
/// its own independent service rather than folded into that class.
///
/// Deliberately starts (and keeps retrying) in parallel with SessionController's own HID dial, not
/// sequenced after its SessionStarted event: the natural point where the Switch needs a game
/// picked is *before* it ever sends a single HID packet (see main.c's init() - the library screen
/// runs, and its listener closes, before startInput() ever runs), so gating this channel's dial
/// behind SessionStarted would deadlock - HID would never start while the Switch waits for this
/// channel to connect, and this channel would never be dialed while waiting for HID. Instead, this
/// keeps trying independently the whole time the app is armed; if the Switch isn't offering this
/// port right now (Steam path, or the picker screen already finished), connect attempts just fail
/// and retry harmlessly, the same way SessionController's own HID retry loop already tolerates
/// "nothing there yet."
