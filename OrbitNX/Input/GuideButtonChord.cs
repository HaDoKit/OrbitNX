/// Turns Minus+Plus pressed together on the Switch into the virtual pad's Guide button (Xbox360 -
/// opens Steam's menu in Big Picture) / PS button (DualShock4). The Switch's own Home button never
/// reaches a homebrew app - the system takes it to the Switch home menu - and neither does Capture,
/// so a chord is the only way to produce the Steam button. Minus+Plus mirrors the familiar
/// Select+Start convention (Moonlight, RetroArch).
///
/// The two buttons are never pressed in exactly the same instant, so a naive mapping would let
/// Big Picture see a short Back or Start first (opening the wrong menu) before Guide. Instead a
/// lone Minus or Plus is withheld for up to <see cref="ChordWindow"/> waiting for its partner:
/// - partner arrives in time: Guide;
/// - held alone past the window: reported as itself from then on;
/// - tapped and released inside the window: still delivered, as a one-packet tap on release - so
///   nothing is lost, just up to ChordWindow late, which is fine for menu/pause buttons.
/// Once the chord has fired, Back/Start stay suppressed until both buttons are released, so
/// letting go of one first can't leak a stray press either.
///
/// One instance per virtual controller slot; Update is called once per incoming HID packet.
