/// gfxcapture (not gdigrab/DXGI) is required because it reads directly from the compositor - GDI
/// BitBlt-based capture misses DirectComposition-rendered layers (Steam overlay, some UI, hardware-
/// accelerated elements). Requires ffmpeg 8.x+.

/// load; UDP has no connection to drop. MPEG-TS's self-synchronizing packet format (sync bytes,
/// continuity counters) tolerates the resulting packet loss. The Switch client
/// (OrbitNX/source/video.c, network.h) decodes via libav (avformat_open_input/avcodec_*).
