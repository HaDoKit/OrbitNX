# OrbitNX features

## What it looks like

OrbitNX runs on two devices on the same network: the PC runs the game and sends video and audio; the
Switch shows them and sends input back.

### Example: launching a game from your library

**1. On the PC**: the Switch's IP address is entered in OrbitNX and streaming is on.

**2. On the Switch**: open OrbitNX and pick a mode. The console's IP address is shown at the bottom of
the screen.

**3. My games**: pick a game from the library you put together on the PC.

**4. The game**: the PC starts the game and it appears on the Switch screen. Play with the Joy-Con or
a Pro Controller.

To return to the menu, hold − for 3 seconds; the game on the PC closes. If you close the game on the
PC, the Switch returns to the menu by itself.

## The PC app

### Main screen

- The **«IP клиента»** (Client IP) field: the Switch's address (remembered).
- **«Включить трансляцию»** / **«Выключить трансляцию»** (Start / Stop streaming): while streaming is
  on, OrbitNX waits for the Switch and connects to it automatically, including after dropouts.
- **Status**: off / waiting for connection / streaming (with the mode name).
- **«Показать экран»** (Show screen): a preview of what is being sent.
- Buttons for the **game library** (gamepad) and **settings** (gear).
- Closing the window minimizes it to the tray; to quit completely, use the tray → «Выход» (Exit).

### Settings

![Settings](images/app/settings.png)

- **Video:** resolution (640×360 to 1920×1080), frame rate (24, 30, 45, 60), bitrate.
- **Adaptive bitrate:** if packets are lost on the Switch, OrbitNX lowers the bitrate (no lower than
  1500 kbps), and after 30 seconds of stable connection carefully raises it back to the configured
  value.
- **Switch layout:** swaps A/B and X/Y.
- **shadPS4:** path to the emulator (found automatically) and a download link.
- **Drivers:** reinstalling ViGEmBus.

### Game library

![Game library on the PC](images/app/library.png)

A list of your games with covers. You can edit or delete each one; changes go to the Switch right away.

![Steam game](images/app/game-edit-steam.png)

![Emulator](images/app/game-edit-emulator.png)

- **Four launch methods:** regular game (`.exe` with arguments and working folder), Steam game
  (picked from the installed ones), emulator (with an argument template using `{rom}`), custom cmd
  script.
- **Gamepad type** per game: Xbox 360 or DualShock 4 with gyro.
- **Capture only the game window:** the game fills the Switch screen even if it runs in a window on
  the PC.
- **Cover:** any image; for Steam games it's filled in automatically.

![Cover framing](images/app/cover-crop.png)

- **Cover framing:** which part of the image to show on the Switch, with a preview.

### What OrbitNX does while streaming

**Modes**
- **Steam** starts Steam (if it isn't running) and opens Big Picture. It tracks games starting and
  closing; after you quit a game, Steam returns to Big Picture by itself. If Big Picture is closed on
  the PC, the session ends.
- **shadPS4** starts the emulator in its gamepad mode.
- **Your own game** is started the right way, and OrbitNX tracks its process, including processes the
  launcher started. The game window gets focus, and capture switches to that window, even if it
  changes (launcher → game, resolution change).
- When the Switch disconnects or goes back to the menu, OrbitNX closes the running game, exits
  Big Picture (Steam itself keeps running) or closes shadPS4.

**Video**
- Captures the primary monitor or the game window through Windows.Graphics.Capture.
- Encodes H.264 on an NVIDIA graphics card (NVENC) with minimal latency; without NVIDIA, on the CPU.
- If capture freezes (this happens when games switch fullscreen mode), OrbitNX restarts it by
  itself.

**Audio**
- Everything playing on the default output device is captured and sent as Opus at 128 kbps.

**Input**
- Up to 4 virtual Xbox 360 or DualShock 4 gamepads (ViGEmBus driver).
- Steam / PS button with − and + together.
- Touches on the Switch screen become touches on the PC (on a game window, taking its position into
  account).
- Gyro and accelerometer in DualShock 4 mode.

**System**
- While streaming, OrbitNX raises its priority and the system timer resolution so audio and video
  don't stutter under game load.
- Turns off the Xbox Game Bar popup that Windows shows when a gamepad connects.
- Doesn't inject into game processes or read their memory; this matters for games with anti-cheat.
- If OrbitNX crashes, the video encoding process exits with it.

## The Switch app

**Menu**
- Three tiles: Steam, shadPS4, My games. The console's IP address is shown at the bottom of the
  screen.
- My games is a grid of your library's covers: A to play, B to go back. The list comes from the PC
  automatically and updates by itself.

**Streaming**
- Hardware video decoding; the newest frame is always the one shown, so latency doesn't build up.
- Audio with packet loss concealment: short gaps are inaudible.
- After a dropout, the app waits for a new connection by itself.

**Input**
- Up to 4 controllers: Joy-Con (as a pair or single), Pro Controller, the console in handheld mode.
- Touch screen and gyro.
- Hold − for 3 seconds to return to the menu; close the app with the HOME button.

**Launching**
- From the Homebrew Menu or from a HOME menu tile (forwarder); see [Installation](installation.en.md).

## Limitations

- Captures the PC's primary monitor (or the game window).
- The Switch shows the picture at 1280×720; sending more is usually pointless.
- A minimized game window sends no picture; some games in exclusive fullscreen mode are only visible
  when capturing the whole monitor.
- The ZL/ZR triggers are sent as on/off presses, without pressure.
- Picture quality depends on Wi-Fi: 5 GHz is better, with the PC wired to the router.
