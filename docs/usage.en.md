# Usage

## First connection

1. Start OrbitNX on the Switch. The console's IP address is shown at the bottom of the menu
   (`IP Address: …`).

2. On the PC, open OrbitNX, enter that address in the **«IP клиента»** (Client IP) field and click
   **«▶ Включить трансляцию»** (Start streaming). The address is remembered.

3. On the Switch, choose what to play (see below). The PC starts the right app, and the picture
   appears on the Switch within a few seconds.

The status under the button shows what's happening: «выключено» (off), «ожидание подключения
клиента…» (waiting for the client: the PC is waiting for the Switch) or «клиент подключён, идёт
трансляция» (client connected, streaming), with the mode name.

## Modes

The Switch menu has three tiles:

- **Steam** opens Steam Big Picture on the PC. From there it's regular Big Picture: library, store,
  launching games. After you quit a game, Steam returns to Big Picture by itself.
- **shadPS4** starts the PlayStation 4 emulator in its gamepad mode. The path to `shadPS4.exe` is set
  in «Настройки» (Settings) → «shadPS4» (OrbitNX tries to find it by itself). In this mode the gamepad
  is a virtual DualShock 4 with gyro.
- **My games** is your own game library with covers. How to fill it is described in
  [Game library](library.en.md). When the game closes on the PC, the Switch returns to the menu.

## Controls

- The Switch buttons, sticks and triggers work as an Xbox 360 gamepad (or a DualShock 4, in shadPS4
  and in library games where it's selected). The ZL/ZR triggers are digital: pressed or released.
- You can connect up to 4 gamepads; each one becomes a separate virtual controller.
- The Switch **touch screen** works as touch on the PC screen (in library games, on the game window).
- **Gyro** is only sent in DualShock 4 mode.

### Gestures

The Switch system keeps the HOME and Capture buttons for itself, so OrbitNX uses gestures instead:

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| **−** and **+** together | Steam (Guide) button: the Steam menu in Big Picture; on DualShock 4, the PS button |
| hold **− for 3 seconds** | back to the OrbitNX menu on the Switch. On the PC, the running game (and Big Picture) is closed |

A single − or + press is delayed by up to 0.1 seconds, while OrbitNX waits to see whether the second
button follows.

## PC settings

The gear button on the OrbitNX main screen.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Resolution | size of the streamed picture. The Switch screen is 1280×720; more is usually unnecessary |
| Frames per second | 60 is smoother; 30 halves the network load and gives a sharper picture at the same bitrate |
| Bitrate (kbps) | video quality. Higher is sharper but harder on Wi-Fi. Lower it if you see artifacts |
| Adaptive bitrate | OrbitNX lowers the bitrate when the connection has problems and raises it back once things are stable. The Bitrate value becomes the upper limit |
| Switch layout (A↔B, X↔Y) | swaps A/B and X/Y so the buttons match the labels on the Switch |
| shadPS4 | path to the emulator |
| Drivers | reinstalls ViGEmBus |

The **«Показать экран»** (Show screen) toggle on the main window shows a preview of what the Switch
sees.

## Stopping

- On the Switch: hold − for 3 seconds to return to the menu, or close the app with HOME.
- On the PC: «Выключить трансляцию» (Stop streaming). If a game was running, OrbitNX closes it and
  exits Big Picture.
