/// Minimal RTP (RFC 3550)-inspired packetizer - a plain 12-byte header (no padding, no extension,
/// no CSRC list) followed by a 2-byte big-endian length prefix and then the payload (one Opus frame).
///
/// The length prefix is NOT part of real RTP - it's a deliberate deviation, needed because multiple
/// UDP sends made close together in time can arrive at the Switch client coalesced into a single
/// read (see OrbitNX/source/audio.c's top doc comment). Bare RTP/Opus has no self-contained length
/// field, so once datagram boundaries can't be trusted to survive the trip, this prefix is what
/// lets the client walk a single read as however many complete [header][length][payload] units
/// actually fit in it.
///
/// Kept separate from AudioCaptureSender so the header-writing logic is independently readable
/// (and testable) rather than buried in the send loop.
