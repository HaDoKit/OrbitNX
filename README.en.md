# OrbitNX

> **Alpha version 0.1.0-alpha.** The project is at an early stage: expect bugs, and settings and the
> protocol may change between versions. Stable operation has so far been confirmed on a single setup
> only; see [Tested configuration](#tested-configuration). For what changed, see
> [CHANGELOG.en.md](CHANGELOG.en.md).

Stream games from a Windows PC to a Nintendo Switch over your local network: video and audio go
from the PC to the console, and input from the Joy-Con, Pro Controller and touch screen goes back to
the PC.

The project has two parts:

- **OrbitNX**: the Windows app (`OrbitNX/`). It launches the game, captures video and audio, sends
  them to the Switch, and turns button presses into a virtual gamepad.
- **OrbitNX for Switch**: a homebrew app (`Client/`). It shows the stream and sends input.

## Features

- **Steam Big Picture**: all of your Steam library, driven by a gamepad.
- **shadPS4**: the PlayStation 4 emulator, with gyro through a virtual DualShock 4.
- **Your own game library**: regular games (`.exe`), Steam games, emulators and custom launch
  scripts, with covers in the Switch menu.
- Up to 4 gamepads; the Switch touch screen works as touch input on the PC.
- Hardware encoding with NVIDIA NVENC and hardware decoding on the Switch.
- Steam button on the Switch: **− + +**. Back to the menu: hold **− for 3 seconds**.

> The PC app's interface is in Russian. The English docs quote its labels in Russian, with a
> translation in parentheses.
