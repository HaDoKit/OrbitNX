# Sends a .nro to hbmenu's netloader and shows the app's logWrite() output live, while also
# appending every line - stamped with this PC's HH:mm:ss.fff, the same format as the host's
# OrbitNX.log - to <LogDir>/nxlink-<start time>.log.
#
# Why not `nxlink -s ... | Tee-Object`: with its stdout redirected into a pipe, nxlink (a mingw
# program) block-buffers its output, so lines showed up in neither the terminal nor the file until
# kilobytes had accumulated - confirmed live, the log stopped right after startup. Instead this
# script plays nxlink's "-s" server itself: the app's nxlinkStdio() (common/logger/logger.c, DEBUG
# builds) connects back to the PC that sent the .nro on TCP 28771, and every line it sends is
# printed and written immediately.
#
# Windows Firewall may ask once to allow PowerShell to accept connections on that port.
