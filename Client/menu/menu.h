// Blocking: draws the app-selection screen (Steam Big Picture / shadPS4 / "My games" - the host's
// library, picked from a cover grid) and polls its own pad input until the user confirms with A -
// or until the app is asked to exit, in which case the caller must check appIsRunning()
// (common/appstate) before carrying on. The pick (and library entry id) goes to
// inputSetAppTarget(). Must run after makeRenderer() (needs the render context/font)
// and before the HID send loop ever starts (so the choice is set before the very first
// OrbitNxHidPacket is sent - see main.c and input.c's inputSetAppTarget()). starSystem must
// already be initialised (starsystem_init) by the caller - it's the same instance drawSplash
// keeps animating afterwards, so the cosmos background doesn't reset/jump when the menu hands off
// to the post-selection waiting screen.
