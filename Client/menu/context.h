// Rendering state for the pre-session app-select menu (menu.c) and its shared background
// (starsystem.c) - a self-contained SDL2 window/renderer/font, created and torn down before
// video.c creates its own for actual gameplay (see main.c). Deliberately NOT shared with video.c:
// this app only ever needs one of the two on screen at a time (menu, then gameplay), so keeping
// them fully independent avoids coupling this screen's lifecycle to video.c's NVTEGRA/SDL2 state.
